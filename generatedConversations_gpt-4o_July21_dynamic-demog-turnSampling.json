    "prompt": "You are simulating realistic conversations between a User and a Virtual Assistant that supports nutrition-related resources and programs.\nThe Virtual Assistant (Bot) asks questions to help match users to programs. The User responds based on their needs and background.\nYou are tasked with generating a full 3–6 turn conversation between Bot and User, grounded in the provided Input Profile.\nThe User's responses should reflect their unique situation and constraints as described in the profile. Be specific and natural.\nUsers speak in a casual, text-like style, sometimes using shorthand, emotion, or context. Their answers may be short or meandering.\nEmbody the perspective of the user in America, making reasonable inferences or elaborations based on the Input Profile.\nEach User turn must include an 'extracted_values' dictionary that maps profile-relevant information surfaced in that turn.\nOutput the entire conversation and annotations as a structured JSON object.\nBelow are example TURNS that illustrate how users reflect profile values.\n[EXAMPLE TURN] {\"turn_id\": 2, \"Bot_Query\": \"Can you tell me more about housing and health?\", \"User_Response\": \"I am at my child's house with their kids.  Everyone is healthy.\", \"extracted_values\": {\"Housing\": [\"homeless\", \"runaways\", \"near homeless\"], \"Health\": [\"DEFAULT\"]}}\n[EXAMPLE TURN] {\"turn_id\": 1, \"Bot_Query\": \"Do you have important considerations regarding role?\", \"User_Response\": \"I don't have one.\", \"extracted_values\": {\"Family Role\": [\"DEFAULT\"]}}\n[EXAMPLE TURN] {\"turn_id\": 0, \"Bot_Query\": \"Hello! I'm here to help you find nutrition resources in your area. How can I help?\", \"User_Response\": \"I'm starving and I can barely see.\", \"extracted_values\": {\"resource\": [\"Meals\"], \"Disability\": [\"visual impairment\", \"limited mobility\"]}}\n\n[PROFILE VALUE CONCRETIZATION INSTRUCTIONS]\nWhen generating User Responses, interpret abstract categories from the Input Profile using specific, realistic examples — e.g. 'resource: Help Pay for Food' → 'SNAP', 'Housing: runaways' → 'social services', and 'Housing: near homeless' → 'crash pad'.\nThese examples help simulate a plausible user situation and make responses more natural. User utterances should speak to the perspective of the user\nYou don't need to use these examples exactly, but they should guide tone and content.\nStill annotate extracted_values based on the original Input Profile keys.\n\n[USER DEMOGRAPHICS]\nThe user has the following additional background:\n- Race: black\n- Gender: female\n- Immigrant Status: no\n- Religion: buddhist\nThese demographics may influence their responses, preferences, and concerns.\nReflect this subtly in their language or concerns if appropriate.\n[OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENT]\nYou must output a single valid JSON object. Only use these profile keys in the 'extracted_values' dictionary for each turn:\n  resource, Disability, Housing, Income, Age Group, Health, Family Family Role.\nDo NOT add any other keys—even if the conversation mentions other topics.\nIf a turn does not refer to any profile-relevant key, 'extracted_values' should be empty or include the relevant keys with the value ['DEFAULT'].\nThe output should look like:\n{\n  \"conversation\": [\n    {\n      \"turn_id\": 0,\n      \"Bot_Query\": \"...\",\n      \"User_Response\": \"...\",\n      \"extracted_values\": {\n        \"<profile_key_1>\": [\"<value_1>\", \"<value_2>\"],\n        \"<profile_key_2>\": [\"<value_3>\"]\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"turn_id\": 1,\n      \"Bot_Query\": \"...\",\n      \"User_Response\": \"...\",\n      \"extracted_values\": {\"<profile_key_n>\": [\"DEFAULT\"]}\n    }\n  ]\n}\nOutput only valid JSON, and nothing else.\n\n\n[GENERATED CONVERSATION]\nInput Profile: {\"resource\": [\"Help Pay for Food\"], \"Income\": [\"DEFAULT\"], \"Housing\": [\"runaways\", \"near homeless\"], \"Family Role\": [\"DEFAULT\"], \"Disability\": [\"DEFAULT\"]}\nOutput: ",

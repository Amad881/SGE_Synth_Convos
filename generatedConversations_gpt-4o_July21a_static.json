User utterances should speak to the perspective of the user\nYou don't need to use these examples exactly, but they should guide tone and content.\nStill annotate extracted_values based on the original Input Profile keys.\n[OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENT]\nYou must output a single valid JSON object. Only use these profile keys in the 'extracted_values' dictionary for each turn:\n  resource, Disability, Housing, Income, Age Group, Health, Family Family Role.\nDo NOT add any other keys—even if the conversation mentions other topics.\nIf a turn does not refer to any profile-relevant key, 'extracted_values' should be empty or include the relevant keys with the value ['DEFAULT'].\nThe output should look like:\n{\n  \"conversation\": [\n    {\n      \"turn_id\": 0,\n      \"Bot_Query\": \"...\",\n      \"User_Response\": \"...\",\n      \"extracted_values\": {\n        \"<profile_key_1>\": [\"<value_1>\", \"<value_2>\"],\n        \"<profile_key_2>\": [\"<value_3>\"]\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"turn_id\": 1,\n      \"Bot_Query\": \"...\",\n      \"User_Response\": \"...\",\n      \"extracted_values\": {\"<profile_key_n>\": [\"DEFAULT\"]}\n    }\n  ]\n}\nOutput only valid JSON, and nothing else.\n\n\n[GENERATED CONVERSATION]\nInput Profile: {\"resource\": [\"Meals\"], \"Income\": [\"low-income\"], \"Housing\": [\"DEFAULT\"], \"Health\": [\"DEFAULT\"], \"Disability\": [\"physical disability\", \"all disabilities\"], \"Family Role\": [\"DEFAULT\"]}\nOutput: ",

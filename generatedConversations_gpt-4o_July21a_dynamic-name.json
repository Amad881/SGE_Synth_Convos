User utterances should speak to the perspective of the user\nYou don't need to use these examples exactly, but they should guide tone and content.\nStill annotate extracted_values based on the original Input Profile keys.\n\n[USER NAME]\nThe user's name is Ali.\nUse this name to help contextualize the user's identity and inform your generation of the User's tone, background, and perspective.\nThe name may suggest cultural, ethnic, or gender associations — you may use these associations subtly when generating the User's responses.\nYou do not need to include the name in the conversation unless the Bot uses it.\n[OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENT]\nYou must output a single valid JSON object. Only use these profile keys in the 'extracted_values' dictionary for each turn:\n  resource, Disability, Housing, Income, Age Group, Health, Family Family Role.\nDo NOT add any other keys—even if the conversation mentions other topics.\nIf a turn does not refer to any profile-relevant key, 'extracted_values' should be empty or include the relevant keys with the value ['DEFAULT'].\nThe output should look like:\n{\n  \"conversation\": [\n    {\n      \"turn_id\": 0,\n      \"Bot_Query\": \"...\",\n      \"User_Response\": \"...\",\n      \"extracted_values\": {\n        \"<profile_key_1>\": [\"<value_1>\", \"<value_2>\"],\n        \"<profile_key_2>\": [\"<value_3>\"]\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"turn_id\": 1,\n      \"Bot_Query\": \"...\",\n      \"User_Response\": \"...\",\n      \"extracted_values\": {\"<profile_key_n>\": [\"DEFAULT\"]}\n    }\n  ]\n}\nOutput only valid JSON, and nothing else.\n\n\n[GENERATED CONVERSATION]\nInput Profile: {\"resource\": [\"Food Delivery\"], \"Family Role\": [\"spouses\", \"caregiver\", \"parents\"], \"Income\": [\"low-income\"], \"Disability\": [\"DEFAULT\"], \"Age Group\": [\"school-aged children: 5 - 12 years\"], \"Housing\": [\"runaways\", \"near homeless\", \"homeless\"]}\nOutput: ",

User utterances should speak to the perspective of the user\nYou don't need to use these examples exactly, but they should guide tone and content.\nStill annotate extracted_values based on the original Input Profile keys.\n\n[USER NAME]\nThe user's name is Ebony.\nUse this name to help contextualize the user's identity and inform your generation of the User's tone, background, and perspective.\nThe name may suggest cultural, ethnic, or gender associations — you may use these associations subtly when generating the User's responses.\nYou do not need to include the name in the conversation unless the Bot uses it.\n[OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENT]\nYou must output a single valid JSON object. Only use these profile keys in the 'extracted_values' dictionary for each turn:\n  resource, Disability, Housing, Income, Age Group, Health, Family Family Role.\nDo NOT add any other keys—even if the conversation mentions other topics.\nIf a turn does not refer to any profile-relevant key, 'extracted_values' should be empty or include the relevant keys with the value ['DEFAULT'].\nThe output should look like:\n{\n  \"conversation\": [\n    {\n      \"turn_id\": 0,\n      \"Bot_Query\": \"...\",\n      \"User_Response\": \"...\",\n      \"extracted_values\": {\n        \"<profile_key_1>\": [\"<value_1>\", \"<value_2>\"],\n        \"<profile_key_2>\": [\"<value_3>\"]\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"turn_id\": 1,\n      \"Bot_Query\": \"...\",\n      \"User_Response\": \"...\",\n      \"extracted_values\": {\"<profile_key_n>\": [\"DEFAULT\"]}\n    }\n  ]\n}\nOutput only valid JSON, and nothing else.\n\n\n[GENERATED CONVERSATION]\nInput Profile: {\"resource\": [\"Meals\"], \"Income\": [\"low-income\"], \"Housing\": [\"DEFAULT\"], \"Health\": [\"DEFAULT\"], \"Disability\": [\"physical disability\", \"all disabilities\"], \"Family Role\": [\"DEFAULT\"]}\nOutput: ",

The User responds based on their needs and background.\nYou are tasked with generating a full 3–6 turn conversation between Bot and User, grounded in the provided Input Profile.\nThe User's responses should reflect their unique situation and constraints as described in the profile. Be specific and natural.\nUsers speak in a casual, text-like style, sometimes using shorthand, emotion, or context. Their answers may be short or meandering.\nEmbody the perspective of the user in America, making reasonable inferences or elaborations based on the Input Profile.\nEach User turn must include an 'extracted_values' dictionary that maps profile-relevant information surfaced in that turn.\nOutput the entire conversation and annotations as a structured JSON object.\nBelow are example CONVERSATIONS that illustrate how users respond in context using their profile.\n[EXAMPLE CONVERSATION 0]\nInput Profile: {\"resource\": [\"Food Delivery\"], \"Age Group\": [\"DEFAULT\"], \"Disability\": [\"DEFAULT\"], \"Housing\": [\"near homeless\"], \"Family Role\": [\"spouses\"], \"Income\": [\"low-income\"], \"Health\": [\"DEFAULT\"]}\nOutput: [{\"turn_id\": 0, \"Bot_Query\": \"Hello!

User utterances should speak to the perspective of the user\nYou don't need to use these examples exactly, but they should guide tone and content.\nStill annotate extracted_values based on the original Input Profile keys.\n[OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENT]\nYou must output a single valid JSON object. Only use these profile keys in the 'extracted_values' dictionary for each turn:\n  resource, Disability, Housing, Income, Age Group, Health, Family Family Role.\nDo NOT add any other keys—even if the conversation mentions other topics.\nIf a turn does not refer to any profile-relevant key, 'extracted_values' should be empty or include the relevant keys with the value ['DEFAULT'].\nThe output should look like:\n{\n  \"conversation\": [\n    {\n      \"turn_id\": 0,\n      \"Bot_Query\": \"...\",\n      \"User_Response\": \"...\",\n      \"extracted_values\": {\n        \"<profile_key_1>\": [\"<value_1>\", \"<value_2>\"],\n        \"<profile_key_2>\": [\"<value_3>\"]\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"turn_id\": 1,\n      \"Bot_Query\": \"...\",\n      \"User_Response\": \"...\",\n      \"extracted_values\": {\"<profile_key_n>\": [\"DEFAULT\"]}\n    }\n  ]\n}\nOutput only valid JSON, and nothing else.\n\n\n[GENERATED CONVERSATION]\nInput Profile: {\"resource\": [\"Meals\"], \"Income\": [\"low-income\"], \"Housing\": [\"DEFAULT\"], \"Health\": [\"DEFAULT\"], \"Disability\": [\"physical disability\", \"all disabilities\"], \"Family Role\": [\"DEFAULT\"]}\nOutput: ",

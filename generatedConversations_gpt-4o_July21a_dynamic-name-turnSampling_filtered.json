The User responds based on their needs and background.\nYou are tasked with generating a full 3\u20136 turn conversation between Bot and User, grounded in the provided Input Profile.\nThe User's responses should reflect their unique situation and constraints as described in the profile. Be specific and natural.\nUsers speak in a casual, text-like style, sometimes using shorthand, emotion, or context. Their answers may be short or meandering.\nEmbody the perspective of the user in America, making reasonable inferences or elaborations based on the Input Profile.\nEach User turn must include an 'extracted_values' dictionary that maps profile-relevant information surfaced in that turn.\nOutput the entire conversation and annotations as a structured JSON object.\nBelow are example TURNS that illustrate how users reflect profile values.\n[EXAMPLE TURN] {\"turn_id\": 2, \"Bot_Query\": \"Do you have important considerations regarding disability?\", \"User_Response\": \"No disabilities.\", \"extracted_values\": {\"Disability\": [\"DEFAULT\"]}}\n[EXAMPLE TURN] {\"turn_id\": 2, \"Bot_Query\": \"Do you have important considerations regarding role and income?\", \"User_Response\": \"I don't work.\", \"extracted_values\": {\"Family Role\": [\"DEFAULT\"], \"Income\": [\"DEFAULT\"]}}\n[EXAMPLE TURN] {\"turn_id\": 1, \"Bot_Query\": \"What details about age group and income should I know?\", \"User_Response\": \"They are a preschooler.

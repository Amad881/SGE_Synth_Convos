Their answers may be short or meandering.\nEmbody the perspective of the user in America, making reasonable inferences or elaborations based on the Input Profile.\nEach User turn must include an 'extracted_values' dictionary that maps profile-relevant information surfaced in that turn.\nOutput the entire conversation and annotations as a structured JSON object.\nBelow are example TURNS that illustrate how users reflect profile values.\n[EXAMPLE TURN] {\"turn_id\": 1, \"Bot_Query\": \"What details about age group and housing and health should I know?\", \"User_Response\": \"I finished school today.

The User responds based on their needs and background.\nYou are tasked with generating a full 3–6 turn conversation between Bot and User, grounded in the provided Input Profile.\nThe User's responses should reflect their unique situation and constraints as described in the profile. Be specific and natural.\nUsers speak in a casual, text-like style, sometimes using shorthand, emotion, or context. Their answers may be short or meandering.\nEmbody the perspective of the user in America, making reasonable inferences or elaborations based on the Input Profile.\nEach User turn must include an 'extracted_values' dictionary that maps profile-relevant information surfaced in that turn.\nOutput the entire conversation and annotations as a structured JSON object.\nBelow are example TURNS that illustrate how users reflect profile values.\n[EXAMPLE TURN] {\"turn_id\": 3, \"Bot_Query\": \"What details about age group should I know?\", \"User_Response\": \"I don't want to talk about how old I am.\", \"extracted_values\": {\"Age Group\": [\"DEFAULT\"]}}\n[EXAMPLE TURN] {\"turn_id\": 3, \"Bot_Query\": \"Can you tell me more about age group and health?\", \"User_Response\": \"I have a young daughter and an adult son coming over.\", \"extracted_values\": {\"Age Group\": [\"preschoolers: 3 - 4 years\", \"young adults: 20 - 30 years\", \"children: 2 - 12 years\"], \"Health\": [\"DEFAULT\"]}}\n\n[PROFILE VALUE CONCRETIZATION INSTRUCTIONS]\nWhen generating User Responses, interpret abstract categories from the Input Profile using specific, realistic examples — e.g. 'resource: Meals' → 'community fridge', 'Age Group: preschoolers: 3 - 4 years' → 'nursery school age', 'Age Group: young adults: 20 - 30 years' → 'DIY enthusiasts', 'Age Group: seniors: 55 years+' → 'senior citizens', 'Age Group: infants: 0 months - 1 year' → 'immature immune system stage', 'Housing: runaways' → 'adolescent shelter', 'Housing: near homeless' → 'tenants' rights groups', 'Housing: homeless' → 'tent city', and 'Disability: visual impairment' → 'ocular condition'.\nThese examples help simulate a plausible user situation and make responses more natural. User utterances should speak to the perspective of the user\nYou don't need to use these examples exactly, but they should guide tone and content.\nStill annotate extracted_values based on the original Input Profile keys.\n\n[USER DEMOGRAPHICS]\nThe user has the following additional background:\n- Race: Asian\n- Gender: male\n- Immigrant Status: no\n- Religion: jewish\nThese demographics may influence their responses, preferences, and concerns.\nReflect this subtly in their language or concerns if appropriate.\n\n[USER NAME]\nThe user's name is Aiko.\nUse this name to help contextualize the user's identity and inform your generation of the User's tone, background, and perspective.\nThe name may suggest cultural, ethnic, or gender associations — you may use these associations subtly when generating the User's responses.\nYou do not need to include the name in the conversation unless the Bot uses it.\n[OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENT]\nYou must output a single valid JSON object. Only use these profile keys in the 'extracted_values' dictionary for each turn:\n  resource, Disability, Housing, Income, Age Group, Health, Family Family Role.\nDo NOT add any other keys—even if the conversation mentions other topics.\nIf a turn does not refer to any profile-relevant key, 'extracted_values' should be empty or include the relevant keys with the value ['DEFAULT'].\nThe output should look like:\n{\n  \"conversation\": [\n    {\n      \"turn_id\": 0,\n      \"Bot_Query\": \"...\",\n      \"User_Response\": \"...\",\n      \"extracted_values\": {\n        \"<profile_key_1>\": [\"<value_1>\", \"<value_2>\"],\n        \"<profile_key_2>\": [\"<value_3>\"]\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"turn_id\": 1,\n      \"Bot_Query\": \"...\",\n      \"User_Response\": \"...\",\n      \"extracted_values\": {\"<profile_key_n>\": [\"DEFAULT\"]}\n    }\n  ]\n}\nOutput only valid JSON, and nothing else.\n\n\n[GENERATED CONVERSATION]\nInput Profile: {\"resource\": [\"Meals\"], \"Age Group\": [\"preschoolers: 3 - 4 years\", \"young adults: 20 - 30 years\", \"seniors: 55 years+\", \"infants: 0 months - 1 year\"], \"Housing\": [\"runaways\", \"near homeless\", \"homeless\"], \"Family Role\": [\"DEFAULT\"], \"Health\": [\"DEFAULT\"], \"Income\": [\"DEFAULT\"], \"Disability\": [\"visual impairment\"]}\nOutput: ",
